**Brek** stands for **B**locking **R**esolution of **E**nvironment **K**eys.

Brek is a powerful yet simple configuration library for Node.js. Itâ€™s structured, typed, and designed for dynamic configuration loading, making it perfect for securely managing secrets (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager). Written in TypeScript for safety and ease of use. Sponsored by [Aeroview](https://aeroview.io).

**ðŸ”’ Out-of-the-box Typescript support**
- Turn your runtime errors into safer compile-time errors! Automatically generated Typescript type definition for configuration object
- Any override must satisfy `Partial<DefaultConfig>` type, or it will throw a Typescript error

**ðŸ˜ƒ Simple, easy-to-use, safe, and stable**
- All settings are in simple, easily readable & logic free `.json` files.
- Enforces a simple and sensible folder structure
- Limited yet powerful feature set with clean documentation
- Small, simple, and modular codebase written in Typescript with no dependencies.

**ðŸ’ª Flexible & powerful**
- Provides for overrides via CLI without polluting the CLI argument namespace
- Differentiates between concepts such as `environment`, `deployment`, and `user` and provides an out-of-the-box
  solution with sensible merge strategy
- Fast. Runtime processing is done during app initialization only.
- Put [environment variables](#environment-variables-in-config-files) directly into .json files

**ðŸ¤– Dynamic loading**
- Great for AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Parameter Store, HashiCorp Vault, or custom dynamic runtime functions
- Any custom logic lives in [loaders](#loaders), keeping your config files logic-free
- Provides an easy sharable and reusable plugin interface for sharing or re-use

# Installation & Setup

## 1. Install from `npm`

```shell
npm i brek
```

## 2. Create `conf` directory

Create a directory called `conf` in the root of your project. This is where your configuration will go, along with the generated Conf.d.ts TypeScript Declaration File. 

> Note: If you want to use a different directory, you can set the `BREK_CONF_DIR` environment variable to the path of your configuration directory.

Here's an example `conf` folder:

```shell script
root/
â””â”€â”€ conf/
    â””â”€â”€ deployments
        â””â”€â”€ test.acme.json
    â””â”€â”€ environments
        â””â”€â”€ development.json
        â””â”€â”€ production.json
    â””â”€â”€ users
        â””â”€â”€ john.json
    â””â”€â”€ default.json
```

At a minimum, `default.json` is required at the root of your `conf` folder. To learn more about the other folders, see [merge strategy](#configuration-merge-strategy) and [configuration rules](#configuration-rules)

## 3. Create your configuration files

Here's a simple example:

__default.json__
```json
{
  "postgres": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "user": "pguser"
  }
  "port": 3000,
  "foo": {
    "bar": true
  }
}
```

At a minimum, `default.json` is required at the root of your `conf` folder. 

See [full configuration rules](#configuration-rules), [merge strategy](#configuration-overrides-and-merge-strategy), and reference the example folder structure above. Also, don't forget to check out [loaders](#loaders) for dynamic runtime configuration.

## 4. Typescript Configuration (tsconfig.json)

Make sure the generated `conf/Conf.d.ts` file will be picked up by your Typescript parser. One way to do this is by including it in your `include` directive like so:

```json
  "include":[
    "src/**/*",
    "conf/Conf.d.ts"
  ],
```

 If you're using `ts-node`, it might help to add the following:

```json
"ts-node": {
  "files": true
}
```

## 5. Call `brek` when your configuration changes to generate the type declaration file

Whenever your `default.json` configuration changes, you'll need to run the `brek` command to build the type declaration file. For example, you could add the following to your `package.json` file:
    
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "postinstall": "brek"
    }
  }
  ```

To run this manually, you can run `npx brek`. This will generate the `Conf.d.ts` file in your `conf` folder.

## 6. Optional: Add generated files to `.gitignore`

You may want to add `conf/Conf.d.ts` and `conf/conf.json` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent them from being checked into source control.

# Loading the Configuration

You must first *load* the configuration, which loads the files from disk, does the merge, and resolves any [loaders](#loaders). You have two options:

1. Use `loadConf()` within your app to load the configuration asynchronously before your app starts.

2. Use `loadConf()` in a script to generate the configuration file before running your app.

Here's an example of using `loadConf()` in your app:

```typescript
import {loadConf, getConf} from "brek";

loadConf()
    .then(() => {
        const conf = getConf();
        console.log(conf);
        // start your server, etc.
    })
    .catch(console.log.bind(console));
```

Here's an example of using `loadConf()` in an init script:

```typescript
import {loadConf} from "brek";

loadConf()
    .then(() => {
        console.log("Configuration loaded successfully");
    })
    .catch(console.log.bind(console));
```


# Getting the config object

Once loaded, use `getConf` to access the configuration object. The configuration is cached after the first load, so you can call `getConf` as many times as you want without worrying about performance.

> Note: If you used `loadConf()` in your app, it will already be in memory. If you used `brek load-conf`, the first call to `getConf` will read from disk.

Example:
`
```typescript
import {getConf} from "brek";

const conf = getConf(); // type of Conf

console.log(conf); // logs config object

const isFooBarEnabled: boolean = conf.foo.bar; // will throw Typescript error as expected if does not exist or is not a boolean
```

If you need the type interface, you can import it:

```typescript
import {Conf} from "brek";
```

# Configuration rules

- `default.json` is required, everything else is optional. Recommended practice is that `default.json` contains all of your "local development" settings.

- All configuration files must be a subset of `default.json`. Think of them simply as overrides to the default. In Typescript terms, conf files must be of type `Partial<Conf>`.

- A property's type should not change simply because of a different environment, user, or deployment. This is basically saying the same as above.

- [Loaders](#loaders) always must return a string. If you need to return a different type, you can use `JSON.parse()` or similar.

- Arrays should be homogenous (not of mixed types).

# Configuration merge strategy

Configurations are merged in this order, with the later ones overriding the earlier ones:
 
1. default.json
2. environment file
3. deployment file
4. user file
5. CLI/env overrides

Which of these sources to choose depends on the presence of certain `process.env` configuration variables:

| **process.env**         | **conf file**                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------|
| `NODE_ENV`              | `/conf/environments/[NODE_ENV].json`  |
| `DEPLOYMENT`            | `/conf/deployments/[DEPLOYMENT].json` |
| `USER`                  | `/conf/users/[USER].json`             |
| `BREK`                  | N/A                                   |
| `OVERRIDE` (deprecated) | N/A                                   |

A few notes:

- `BREK` must be valid JSON. [Learn more](#using-cli-overrides)
- `USER` is usually provided by default by UNIX environments (try `console.log(process.env.USER)`)
- [Loaders](#loaders) parameters are simply replaced, not merged. A `loader` instance is treated as a primitive.
- Arrays are simply replaced, not merged.

# Using CLI/env overrides

You can use the `BREK` environment variable to override properties via CLI/ENV. `BREK` must be valid JSON. Using `jq` simplifies dynamic JSON construction, ensures proper quoting, and makes it easier to handle environment variables.

## Examples

```bash
# Override the a.b property
BREK=$(jq -n '{a: {b: "q"}}') ts-node src/index.ts

# Override the postgres property wth an environment variable
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db"
BREK=$(jq -n --arg db "$DATABASE_URL" '{postgres: $db}') ts-node src/index.ts
```

# Environment variables in config files

You can use environment variables as values by wrapping it in `${...}`. For example, to use environment variable `FOO`, use `${FOO}`. This will translate to `process.env.FOO`. These will always be typed as strings. Example config file:

```json
{
  "foo": "${FOO}"
}
```

# Loaders

Loaders are custom functions that are called during startup (run-time). This can be used to do anything, such as fetching secrets from AWS Secrets Manager, or any other dynamic runtime operation. They can be Promise/async/await based.

## Example

_conf/default.json_
```json
{
  "foo": {
    "[fetchSecret]": {
      "key": "demo"
    }   
  },
  "bar": {
    "[add10]": 42
  }
}
```
_index.ts_

```typescript
import {loadConfig, getConf} from "brek";

const loaders = {
    fetchSecret: (params: {key: string}) => Promise.resolve(`secret_${a}`),
    add10: (val: number) => String(val + 10),
};

loadConfig(loaders)
    .then(() => {
        console.log(getConf().foo); // "secret_demo"
        console.log(getConf().bar); // "52"
        //start server, etc.
    })
    .catch(console.log.bind(console));
```

## Usage

Loader functions must extend `(params: any) => string`. If helpful, you can import the `Loader` type like so:

```typescript
import type {Loader} from 'brek';
```

In a conf file, any object with a single property matching the pattern wrapped in square brackets (`[...]`) is assumed to be a loader. The key is the loader name, and the value is the parameter passed to the loader.

If a matching loader is not found, it will throw a `LoaderNotFound` error. Loaders must return strings.

# Recommended best practices

- `default.json` should contain all of your local development settings, and then "progressively enhance" from there.
- Include `loadConf().then(...)` or `await loadConf()` in your startup process before your server starts listening (ie, before `app.listen()`).
- Create all of the merge folders (ie. deployments) even if you're not using them.
- Use AWS Secrets Manager or Hashicorp Vault to store your sensitive information and use a [loader](#loaders) to load them.

# Debugging

You can set the `LAMBDA_CONF_DEBUG` environment variable to see debug output. Example:

```shell script
LAMBDA_CONF_DEBUG=1 ts-node src/index.ts
```

> Use with caution! This may output sensitive information to the console.

# Known issues

1. Some IDEs (particularly IntelliJ/Webstorm) occasionally have some issues with caching of the generated `Conf.d.ts file` (which is stored in your `conf` folder). If you run into this problem, restarting your TS service.
