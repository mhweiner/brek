**Brek** stands for **B**locking **R**esolution of **E**nvironment **K**eys.

Brek is a powerful yet simple configuration library for Node.js. Itâ€™s structured, typed, and designed for dynamic configuration loading, making it perfect for securely managing secrets (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager). Written in TypeScript for safety and ease of use. Sponsored by [Aeroview](https://aeroview.io).

**ðŸ”’ Out-of-the-box Typescript support**
- Turn your runtime errors into safer compile-time errors! Automatically generated Typescript type definition for configuration object
- Any override must satisfy `Partial<DefaultConfig>` type, or it will throw a Typescript error

**ðŸ˜ƒ Simple, easy-to-use, safe, and stable**
- All settings are in simple, logic free `.json` files.
- Adds structure and organization to your configuration files
- Easily see what is being overridden and where
- Comprehensive yet easy to understand documentation
- Small, modular, and unit-tested codebase written in Typescript **with no dependencies**.

**ðŸ’ª Flexible & powerful**
- Differentiates between concepts such as `environment`, `deployment`, and `user` and provides an out-of-the-box solution with sensible merge strategy
- Provides for overrides via CLI without polluting the CLI argument namespace
- Fast. Runtime processing is done during app initialization only.
- Put [environment variables](#environment-variables-in-config-files) directly into .json files

**ðŸ¤– Dynamic loading**
- Great for AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Parameter Store, HashiCorp Vault, or custom dynamic runtime functions
- Any custom logic lives in [loaders](#loaders), keeping your config files logic-free
- Provides an easy sharable and reusable plugin interface for sharing or re-use

# Quick Example

_conf/default.json_
```json
{
  "foo": "bar",
  "baz": {
    "qux": 42
  }
}
```

_index.ts_
```typescript
import {loadConf, getConf} from "brek";

loadConf()
    .then(() => {
        console.log(getConf().foo); // "bar" fully typed âœ…
        console.log(getConf().baz.qux); // 42 fully typed âœ…
        console.log(getConf().baz.oof); // Typescript error ðŸ’¥
        //start server, etc.
    })
    .catch(console.log.bind(console));
```


# Getting Started

To install and get started with `brek`, see our [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) guide.

# Configuration rules

- `default.json` is required, everything else is optional. Recommended practice is that `default.json` contains all of your "local development" settings.

- All configuration files must be a subset of `default.json`. Think of them simply as overrides to the default. In Typescript terms, conf files must be of type `Partial<Conf>`.

- A property's type should not change simply because of a different environment, user, or deployment. This is basically saying the same as above.

- [Loaders](#loaders) always must return a string. If you need to return a different type, you can use `JSON.parse()` or similar.

- Arrays should be homogenous (not of mixed types).

# Configuration merge strategy

Configurations are merged in this order, with the later ones overriding the earlier ones:
 
1. default.json
2. environment file
3. deployment file
4. user file
5. CLI/env overrides

Which of these sources to choose depends on the presence of certain `process.env` configuration variables:

| **process.env**         | **conf file**                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------|
| `NODE_ENV`              | `/conf/environments/[NODE_ENV].json`  |
| `DEPLOYMENT`            | `/conf/deployments/[DEPLOYMENT].json` |
| `USER`                  | `/conf/users/[USER].json`             |
| `BREK`                  | N/A                                   |
| `OVERRIDE` (deprecated) | N/A                                   |

A few notes:

- `BREK` must be valid JSON. [Learn more](#using-cli-overrides)
- `USER` is usually provided by default by UNIX environments (try `console.log(process.env.USER)`)
- [Loaders](#loaders) parameters are simply replaced, not merged. A `loader` instance is treated as a primitive.
- Arrays are simply replaced, not merged.

# Using CLI/env overrides

You can use the `BREK` environment variable to override properties via CLI/ENV. `BREK` must be valid JSON. Using `jq` simplifies dynamic JSON construction, ensures proper quoting, and makes it easier to handle environment variables.

## Examples

```bash
# Override the a.b property
BREK=$(jq -n '{a: {b: "q"}}') ts-node src/index.ts

# Override the postgres property wth an environment variable
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db"
BREK=$(jq -n --arg db "$DATABASE_URL" '{postgres: $db}') ts-node src/index.ts
```

# Environment variables in config files

You can use environment variables as values by wrapping it in `${...}`. For example, to use environment variable `FOO`, use `${FOO}`. This will translate to `process.env.FOO`. These will always be typed as strings. Example config file:

```json
{
  "foo": "${FOO}"
}
```

# Loaders

Loaders are custom functions that are called during startup (run-time). This can be used to do anything, such as fetching secrets from AWS Secrets Manager, or any other dynamic runtime operation. They can be Promise/async/await based.

## Example

_conf/default.json_
```json
{
  "foo": {
    "[fetchSecret]": {
      "key": "demo"
    }   
  },
  "bar": {
    "[add10]": 42
  }
}
```
_index.ts_

```typescript
import {loadConfig, getConf} from "brek";

const loaders = {
    fetchSecret: (params: {key: string}) => Promise.resolve(`secret_${a}`),
    add10: (val: number) => String(val + 10),
};

loadConfig(loaders)
    .then(() => {
        console.log(getConf().foo); // "secret_demo"
        console.log(getConf().bar); // "52"
        //start server, etc.
    })
    .catch(console.log.bind(console));
```

## Usage

Loader functions must extend `(params: any) => string`. If helpful, you can import the `Loader` type like so:

```typescript
import type {Loader} from 'brek';
```

In a conf file, any object with a single property matching the pattern wrapped in square brackets (`[...]`) is assumed to be a loader. The key is the loader name, and the value is the parameter passed to the loader.

If a matching loader is not found, it will throw a `LoaderNotFound` error. Loaders must return strings.

# API

## `loadConf(loaders?: Loaders): Promise<void>`

Loads the configuration files from disk, merges them, resolves any loaders,
and writes the final configuration to `conf.json`. This function must be called before `getConf()`.

- `loaders` (optional): An object containing loader functions. The key is the loader name, and the value is the loader function.

## `getConf(): Conf`

Returns the configuration object. This function must be called after `loadConf()`.

# Recommended best practices

- `default.json` should contain all of your local development settings, and then "progressively enhance" from there.
- Use AWS Secrets Manager or Hashicorp Vault to store your sensitive information and use a [loader](#loaders) to load them.

# Debugging

You can set the `BREK_DEBUG` environment variable to see debug output. Example:

```shell script
BREK_DEBUG=1 ts-node src/index.ts
```

> Use with caution! This may output sensitive information to the console.

# Known issues

1. Some IDEs (particularly IntelliJ/Webstorm) occasionally have some issues with caching of the generated `Conf.d.ts file` (which is stored in your `conf` folder). If you run into this problem, restarting your TS service.
